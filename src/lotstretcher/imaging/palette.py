"""
Turning a vehicle's own colors into a backdrop palette.

The scraped record carries colors as MARKETING names ("Agate Black",
"Antimatter Blue", "Avalanche"), not values, so this does two things:
parses the name for a base color word, and -- when the name is pure
branding with no color word in it at all, which "Avalanche" and
"Carbonized" both are -- falls back to measuring the paint straight off
the vehicle's own cutout. The fallback is the reliable one; the name map
just avoids a file read when the answer is already written down.
