"""
Perceptual-hash filtering for known junk/marketing images.

Dealer photo galleries sometimes have a fixed promotional graphic (a
"check our reviews!" card, etc.) mixed in among the actual vehicle photos --
the same exact image, reused across every vehicle in inventory. Since it's
a specific known image rather than a general category, perceptual hashing
(pHash) catches it far more cheaply and reliably than OCR or a trained
classifier would, with no risk of false-positives from e.g. text visible on
an infotainment screen in a real interior shot.

Add more known-junk images to templates/ as they turn up; no code changes
needed -- BUT read the next paragraph before adding one that looks like a
studio photo, because the threshold has far less room than it appears.

MEASURED HEADROOM, and the trap. Against the one template currently in
templates/ (a full-bleed "reviews" card) the filter is comfortable: over
1,074 real gallery photos the CLOSEST sits 20 bits away, against a
threshold of 8, with a median of 32 -- i.e. uncorrelated. Nothing real is
anywhere near being dropped.

That safety comes from the template being a flat graphic, not from the
threshold being conservative. On this dealer's actual vehicle photography
-- studio renders of one vehicle on a uniform grey floor, framed almost
identically shot to shot -- pHash is dominated by the background and
framing rather than by the car. Measured over 420 exterior photos, 466
pairs belonging to DIFFERENT vehicles fall within the 8-bit threshold of
each other, and spot-checking those at pixel level shows most are not
duplicates at all (a Tesla Model Y and a Toyota Camry match at 8 bits with
a mean pixel difference of 14/255).

So a junk template that resembles a studio shot would silently delete real
photos across most of the inventory, and the deletion happens before any
classifier sees them. Keep templates to flat, full-bleed graphics; if one
ever needs to be a photo, verify it against the fleet first rather than
trusting the 8-bit threshold.

A genuine cross-vehicle duplicate does exist and is worth knowing about
for a different reason: the two Transit vans share manufacturer renders
outright (0 bits, 0.00 mean pixel difference on some frames), because the
dealer merchandises them with factory imagery rather than photographs of
the actual vans. That is not junk and must not be filtered -- it is the
only photography those listings have.

# has already been downloaded and fully processed for a DIFFERENT vehicle
# -- overwhelmingly manufacturer stock renders, since the dealer's CDN
# mints a fresh unique URL per vehicle even for byte-identical content
# (confirmed: dozens of same-trim new vehicles, e.g. Bronco Sport BIG
# Bend, share 13-14 of 14 exterior photos outright). The download itself
# can't be skipped -- there is no URL-level signal, only the bytes prove
# identity -- but the expensive part (CLIP classification, rembg cutout)
# can be, by reusing what an earlier vehicle already computed for the
# identical content instead of redoing it. Nothing is stripped from any
# vehicle's output: every photo is still saved to that vehicle's own
# gallery exactly as before, just without redundant GPU work behind it.
#
# EXACT hash match, then a pixel confirmation, same conservative pairing
# the fleet's own photography needs: 466 pairs from genuinely DIFFERENT
# vehicles fall within the 8-bit junk-filter threshold of each other (a

# is safe here. See the module docstring for that measurement.
