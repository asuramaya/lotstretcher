"""
Gallery-level check that every cutout is a cutout OF THIS VEHICLE.

Every other classifier in imaging/ asks "what is in this photo?". None of
them asks "is the thing in this photo the car we're selling?", and that
gap produced two real production failures:

  1. A Volkswagen Atlas photo shot from the driver's seat, looking out
     through the windshield at the dealer lot. rembg fused the rear-view
     mirror with a silver Hyundai parked outside into ONE connected blob
     (verified: single component at every alpha threshold), and that blob
     became the hero shot of the vehicle's still AND its video.
  2. A Ford Transit cargo-bay photo whose ghostly open rear doors were cut
     out as if they were a vehicle body.

Neither is detectable by asking a question about the photo's content,
because nothing is wrong with the content. The Atlas photo really is
dominated by car exteriors -- six of them, none an Atlas. The defect is
REFERENTIAL, not semantic: it is a fine picture of the wrong car. So the
only test that can see it is one that has a referent, which is what this
module supplies -- it never asks "what is this?", only "is this the same
thing as the vehicle's other cutouts?".

Five other approaches were measured and rejected first. Recording them
because each looked correct until it was measured against real photos:

  - Adding "cargo_bay"/"through_glass" to SCENE_LABELS' 5-way choice.
    Caught both failures, but cargo_bay is a WHITE-VAN sink: 16 of the 18
    photos it claimed were clean Transit body shots, including the best
    hero photo either van had (front 3/4, scored cargo_bay 0.898). Would
    have left both Transits with zero exterior cutouts. through_glass ate
    5 of 8 -- exterior mirror close-ups shot from outside, dragged in by
    the word "mirror" in its own prompt. Same lesson WHEEL_DETAIL_LABELS
    and SPARE_TIRE_LABELS already record: widening a broad multi-way
    choice makes a new catch-all, and the counts won't reveal it -- only
    looking at the images will.
  - CLIP on the CUTOUT with a "whole vehicle" prompt. Inverted: both bad
    blobs scored 0.71/0.88 while a dozen flawless cutouts scored
    0.05-0.21, because "the entire vehicle body visible from bumper to
    bumper" grades VIEWPOINT -- rear and side profiles can't show both
    bumpers and sank, while the Hyundai in the mirror blob is a textbook
    front 3/4 and floated. No prompt fixes this: that blob genuinely
    contains a complete car, so "is there a whole vehicle here?" is
    truthfully yes.
  - Camera-position ("inside" vs "outside") over cutout candidates.
    Nailed the Transit (0.998) but scored the Atlas 0.117 -- outside,
    which is arguably right, the frame IS mostly outdoors -- and called
    49 of 156 legitimate cutouts "inside", almost all front-3/4 studio
    shots where the cabin is visible through the windshield.
  - Self-consistency normalised PER GALLERY, to avoid a magic constant.
    Both variants are worse than the raw value: MAD z-score fails
    outright (a good Mustang cutout becomes the biggest outlier in the
    fleet at -8.79, because a tight gallery drives MAD toward zero), and
    ratio-to-median shrinks the genuine/impostor margin from 0.042 to
    0.012.
  - Largest-gap dynamic splitting, same motive. Four CLEAN galleries
    split harder than the two bad ones (Camry 5.37x, Expedition 3.94x vs
    2.76x/2.91x for the real failures).

The last three all fail for one reason, and it is the reason this module
needs TWO keys rather than one: they measure distance from the gallery,
and a legitimate dead-on rear or side shot is also distant from a gallery
otherwise made of 3/4 views. Self-consistency alone cannot separate "a
different angle of the same car" from "a different car".

Paint colour can, because it is angle-invariant -- the property the
embedding lacks. So a cutout is only demoted when BOTH agree: it doesn't
look like its siblings AND it isn't painted like them. The two keys are
independent in practice, which is what makes the rule safe to act on
unsupervised.

Calibrated by cross-gallery injection over the 21-vehicle fleet: score
every cutout against every OTHER vehicle's gallery, giving 3068 real
impostors instead of the 2 reported failures. At the thresholds below:

    genuine cutouts demoted     0 / 154   (0.0%)
    realistic impostors caught  29.9% of 3068
    the 2 reported failures     2 / 2     (0.561/188.1 and 0.588/136.3)

Zero false positives held across every operating point from 0.65/100 to
0.80/120, and no genuine cutout comes close to failing both keys: the
worst by colour is 0.847/120.2 (similarity nowhere near the line), the
worst by similarity is 0.753/101.3 (colour fine).

Two limits worth knowing. Same-MODEL twins are invisible -- two white
Transits of the same generation score 0.955 against each other -- so the
signal's real ceiling is "is this the same model", not "the same car";
that is harmless here only because a scrape pulls from one VDP, so a
different Transit can never enter this Transit's gallery. And the
impostors this misses are the ones whose paint happens to match the
target vehicle, which is also the least visually jarring failure: a
silver blob in a silver car's gallery doesn't read as broken, while a
black mirror and a white Hyundai in a white Atlas's gallery does.

# Below this many cutouts the check abstains entirely rather than guessing.

MAX_DEMOTE_FRACTION = 0.5

# CERTAIN_SIMILARITY above is a measurement of THIS dealer's photos, not a
# law, so calibrate() re-derives it from whatever gallery is actually on
# disk and writes the answer here for the scrape path to pick up. The
# method is the one Beta-SOD uses for noisy re-ID galleries (arXiv
# 2509.08926): fit a Beta to each population -- within-gallery pairs are
# "same vehicle", cross-gallery pairs are "different vehicle" -- and put
# the boundary where the impostor density overtakes the genuine one.
#
# Three deliberate choices on top of that:
#
#   * The boundary is weighted by CALIBRATION_PRIOR, an explicit statement
#     of how often a foreign cutout is expected, because "assume at most 1
#     cutout in 100 doesn't belong" is a claim about the world that can be
#     argued with. A bare similarity number is not.
#   * The fit is bootstrapped and a LOW percentile is taken rather than
#     the point estimate. On this fleet the point estimate lands at 0.597
#     with sd 0.014, and 1 resample in 40 put it ABOVE the worst genuine
#     cutout (0.625) -- close enough to matter. The 10th percentile lands
#     at 0.581, restoring a 0.044 margin.
#   * Same-model pairs are excluded from the impostor population. Two
#     white Transits of the same generation score 0.955 against each other
#     and would drag the boundary up over nothing: a scrape pulls one VDP,
#     so a different Transit can never enter this Transit's gallery.

    """Self-heal counterpart to demote_foreign_cutouts(): re-runs the
    CURRENT evaluate_photo() against every photo already sitting in
    images/interior/, promoting any it now calls exterior.

    Exists because already_fetched() means a vehicle is only ever
    classified ONCE, at scrape time -- a classifier fix or threshold
    change (see imaging/pipeline.py's INTERIOR_TIEBREAK_THRESHOLD history,
    and the DETAIL_LABEL gap documented right below it) never
    retroactively applies to vehicles already on disk. A folder scraped
    before the fix existed just stays wrong forever unless someone
    manually re-audits it -- which is literally how the 2026-09 fleet
    audit that motivated this function was done, by hand, for exactly 2
    vehicles out of 10 candidates. This is what makes that repeatable.

    Deliberately conservative in ways confirmed necessary by that same
    audit -- 7 of the 10 "exterior-looking" interior photos found were NOT
    genuine recoverable misfiles:
      1. A photo only promotes if it also produces a valid cutout
         (remove_background's own quality gate). This alone doesn't catch
         everything: most DETAIL_LABEL misfires on a tight interior
         close-up (a door handle, a console button) still segment
         "successfully" by rembg's standards -- see (2).
      2. A promoted cutout is checked against find_foreign_cutouts() on a
         STAGED COPY of the real gallery before anything is written -- if
         the gallery consensus check would demote it right back (common:
         an unusual close-up framing genuinely doesn't resemble the
         vehicle's other shots), it's left alone. Forcing it through would
         reintroduce exactly the foreign-cutout-fusion bug class that
         check exists to prevent. If the existing gallery is too small for
         the consensus check to form an opinion at all, that's ALSO
         treated as "don't promote" (find_foreign_cutouts' own "empty
         means no opinion, not all clean" contract), not as tacit
         approval.
      3. Wheel-eligible-looking candidates (should_extract_wheel() would
         route them to the wheel pipeline) are reported but not promoted
         -- this only implements the general whole-vehicle cutout path,
         not the wheel money-shot path. Rare in practice.

    Caller is responsible for regenerating deliverables for any vehicle
    with a promotion (recompose --interiors, then hero-video) -- this
    function only touches the raw photo/cutout/angles.json layer, same
    division of labour as demote_foreign_cutouts().

    `outcome` on each returned ReclassifiedPhoto is one of: "promoted",
    "rejected_by_gallery", "cutout_failed", "wheel_eligible_skipped",
    "insufficient_gallery", "classify_failed". A photo the current
    classifier still calls interior isn't returned at all -- that's not a
    finding, it's confirmation nothing needs to change.
