"""
Animated version of compose_hero(): a looping video background (e.g. a
waving American flag) instead of a still, with a 3-slot CONVEYOR --
left accent, hero, right accent -- that continuously rotates through the
vehicle's whole shot library, timed to the beat of a looping audio track.

THE CONVEYOR: at any moment the 3 visible shots are simply 3 consecutive
entries of the (already front-to-rear ordered) shot list: left=shots[i-1],
hero=shots[i], right=shots[i+1]. Every bar, i advances by 1 and the whole
window slides. What makes this read as one continuous cycle instead of 3
independently-cutting slots is that each shot's OWN journey through the 3
slots is animated as a single throughline instead of 3 unrelated
crossfades:
  - The outgoing hero (shots[i]) doesn't just disappear -- it shrinks and
    moves into the left slot, becoming the new left accent.
  - The old left accent (shots[i-1]) fades out in place -- its journey
    ends here, it's been hero and left already.
  - The current right accent (shots[i+1]) grows and moves down into the
    hero slot, becoming the new hero.
  - A brand new shot (shots[i+2]) fades in at the right slot -- entering
    the conveyor for the first time.
Every shot's lifecycle is therefore: fade in at right -> grow into hero ->
shrink into left -> fade out. Confirmed this needed to be a real
position+scale morph, not independent alpha crossfades per slot -- an
earlier version faded new accent content in from nowhere (no visible
relationship to what was just on screen) and it read as random/jarring
rather than a cycle.

PAN, INTEGRATED WITH THE CONVEYOR: a shot whose native aspect is much
wider than the hero box (a side profile, mainly) fills the box's full
height and drives across it, entering and leaving past the frame edges.

The key is that EVERY appearance of a shot -- accent slot, static hero,
panning hero, and every intermediate frame of a morph -- is ONE rect:
where the whole, undistorted image is drawn. Nothing is ever clipped to a
sub-frame window. A pan is then just "draw wider than the frame and slide
it sideways," an accent is the same image drawn small, and the morph
between them is a plain interpolation of that single rect -- from the
exact frame steady playback left off at, to the exact frame it resumes
at, so there's no cut, no dissolve, and no pop at either boundary. The
vehicle is always whole; the frame's own edge (supplied by the border art
composited on top) is the only thing that ever hides part of it, which
reads as driving off screen.

Four earlier attempts are worth not repeating, all of them variations on
treating a pan as "an image inside a window":
  1. Interpolating the pan's window rect straight to an accent rect
     force-resized the image into shapes it doesn't have -- visible
     squish.
  2. A separate aspect-correct hero endpoint fixed the squish but landed
     the morph somewhere other than where the pan actually sits, so the
     hand-off popped.
  3. Cross-dissolving to hide that pop left the pan's edges gapped
     mid-transition.
  4. Carrying a real clip window (correct while the window WAS the frame)
     dragged a hard vertical edge across the vehicle's body the moment
     that window began shrinking toward the accent slot -- a truck cut in
     half in mid-frame.
The fix for all four is the same: there is no window. Draw the whole
thing and let it leave the frame.

Pan direction is set so the vehicle slides the way it FACES, which is
what reads as driving forward -- the cutout is a sprite over a static
flag, so it is the moving object; a right-facing vehicle sliding left
reads as reversing, however natural "reveal the tail then the hood"
sounds in the abstract. Which way any given photo faces is detected, not
assumed -- see imaging/classify.py::detect_hood_side(); confirmed real
need, since this vehicle's own two side shots face opposite ways.

MUSICAL TIMING CONTRACT: the audio file passed in MUST be a clean,
seamlessly-looping BARS_PER_LOOP-bar segment (4 by default) for the bar/
beat math below to land on the actual music -- there's no beat detection
here, just audio_loop_seconds / 4 bars / 4 beats-per-bar. A file that
isn't a clean 4-bar loop will make the conveyor's cuts and the hero's
pump drift off the actual downbeats. This is a real constraint on the
input, not an implementation detail to work around -- see
probe_duration_s().

Rendering strategy:
  - Every shot's placement (resized + collision-resolved position) in
    each of the 3 boxes is precomputed ONCE per shot -- 3 placements x N
    shots, not per frame.
  - During the STEADY portion of each bar (most of it), the 3 layers
    (left/hero/right) are simple pastes at their precomputed positions --
    cheap. Only the beat pulse (hero only) needs a live per-frame resize.
  - During the TRANSITION portion (the last `crossfade` seconds of each
    bar), all 4 moving/fading elements are recomposited live -- 2 morphs
    (resize from the shot's own full-res image at the current interpolated
    box size, not from an already-downscaled version, to avoid
    double-resampling) and 2 alpha fades (cheap: reuse the precomputed
    resting-size image, just scale its alpha channel).
  - The flag clip's own frames are decoded and cover-cropped to the canvas
    size ONCE, then reused via modulo indexing no matter how long the
    final video runs.
Frames are streamed to ffmpeg over a pipe as raw rgb24 rather than written
to disk as an intermediate PNG sequence.
