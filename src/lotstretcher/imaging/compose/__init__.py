"""
Hero image composition, split into small pieces so each concern (window
detection, background fit/dim, layout geometry, car-cutout effects,
top-level orchestration) can be read and changed independently:

  window.py     -- detect_window(): find a border's transparent car-window
  background.py -- fit_background(), compute_dim_strength(), apply_spotlight()
  layout.py     -- compute_placement(), named layouts (single/corners/quad)
  effects.py    -- paste_with_glow() and other car-cutout treatments
  hero.py        -- compose_hero(): wires the above together

Import from this package (`from imaging.compose import compose_hero`) --
the submodule split is an implementation detail, not part of the public API.
