"""
A rotating "spin" video from a vehicle's own real angle-labeled cutouts --
the used-inventory-appropriate alternative to a licensed generic 3D CAD
model (right for new inventory, wrong for used: it shows the SKU, not the
actual physical car with its actual wear).

WHAT THIS IS NOT: true 3D reconstruction (photogrammetry / NeRF / Gaussian
Splatting) of the real vehicle. That's confirmed research-stage industry-
wide as of 2025-2026 (see decision 1449fdef, lotstretcher project graph) -- even
the field's own state of the art needed a purpose-built moving-vehicle
capture rig, not reprocessing of static lot photos. Nobody ships that at
scale yet, lotstretcher included.

WHAT THIS IS: the same class of trick CarCutter's own documented "NextGen
360" actually uses -- synthesize a smooth rotation from a HANDFUL of real
photos rather than requiring a turntable shoot. CarCutter's version works
from 4 photos (front/rear/left/right) with a trained view-interpolation
model. This version is classical, not learned: cross-dissolve between the
real angle-labeled cutouts already sitting in a vehicle's cutout gallery
(lotstretcher typically has 5 distinct angles per vehicle -- front, front_3q,
side, rear_3q, rear -- MORE real anchor frames than CarCutter's own
baseline), scaled/anchored to a consistent canvas position so the car
doesn't visibly jump or resize between shots. It reads as a rotation, not
a slideshow, but it is honest about being an interpolation between real
photos rather than a synthesized new viewpoint -- there is no attempt to
paint in geometry the source photos don't show.

SCOPE: one side's half-turn (front through rear along whichever side has
the fuller angle coverage), not a full 360 -- completing the other side
needs real photos of it, which isn't guaranteed per vehicle. Extending to
a full loop (this side, then a hard cut/dissolve to the mirrored return)
is a reasonable next step once this baseline is validated against real
output.
