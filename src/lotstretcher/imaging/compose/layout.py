A layout is a function (window, n_extra) -> [(box, anchor), ...], always
hero first. compose_hero() zips this 1:1 against the car_paths it's given,
so the caller (imaging/select.py, or a CLI) is responsible for handing

    Same idea as corners_layout, retuned for a frame where all three
    slots are ALWAYS occupied -- corners_layout has to look right with 0,
    1, or 2 accents and with a hero that may be the only thing on screen,
    so it leaves generous air. Here the video was measurably empty:
    832px of content in a 1046px window (20% dead), with the worst gap
    236px of bare background between a short accent and the hero.

    Two changes, each aimed at one measured cause:
      - Boxes are bigger (0.46w x 0.34h vs 0.40 x 0.30) and the row gap
        tighter, so the accents themselves occupy more of the top band.
      - The hero box takes everything below that band; hero_video.py
        pairs this with a much smaller inset than the still pipeline's
        (see HERO_MARGIN_FRAC), since a video frame is viewed briefly and
        wants to read big, where a still is looked at.

    Accents stay CENTER-anchored. Bottom-anchoring them was tried, and it
    does close the gap to the hero -- a wide side profile only fills
    174px of a 356px box, so dropping it to a shared baseline with the
    other accent cut the worst gap from 236px to 73px. But it reads
    wrong: a short wide shot pinned to the bottom of an invisible box
    looks like it's sinking, with all of its slack stacked above it,
    while centering splits the slack evenly and reads as deliberate
    letterboxing. Note this only affects wide/short shots -- an accent
    that fills its box height (a wheel, a straight-on front) lands within
    ~1px either way, so this is not a general "align everything" knob.

    n_extra is accepted for signature compatibility and ignored -- the
    conveyor is always exactly hero + 2.

    conveyor_layout cannot be reused on a vertical frame. Measured on a
    1080x1920 canvas it produces a 0.87:1 hero box and 0.76:1 accent
    boxes -- portrait boxes, which is the worst possible shape for an
    object whose median aspect is 1.80:1. A median vehicle fills 48% of
    that hero box and 42% of an accent. The frame isn't badly composed,
    it's mostly empty.

    So the accents move above and below the hero rather than sitting in
    its top corners. The important detail is that they must also be
    NARROWER than the hero: everything in a tall frame is width-
    constrained, so three full-width slots would draw the vehicle at
    exactly the same size in all three and the hero/accent hierarchy
    would vanish entirely. 0.62 width keeps roughly the same
    accent-to-hero size ratio the square layout has (0.46/1.0).

    Boxes are sized to the content's aspect rather than to equal shares
    of the height, and whatever height is left over becomes air between
    them -- a tall composition wants that spacing, and sizing the boxes
    to fill the frame is what produced the 48% number above.

    Slot order matches conveyor_layout's [hero, outgoing, incoming], so
    hero_video.py's animation is unchanged: a shot fades in at the BOTTOM
    accent, grows into the hero, shrinks into the TOP accent and fades
    out. The travel reads upward, which suits a vertical frame.
