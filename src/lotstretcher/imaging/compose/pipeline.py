Per-vehicle image-composition pipeline: one hero collage (quad: hero + 3
distinct accents when the gallery actually has that many angles, else
corners: hero + 1-2 bigger accents -- see select.py::pick_adaptive() for
why quad's fixed 4 slots look sparse/wasteful on a vehicle with fewer real
angles) PLUS a solo "framed" image for every exterior cutout, including the
ones already in the collage, since they only show up small there. Each
framed image is scaled to fill the border's window as big as the
collision-avoidance logic allows, with the same background/vignette/glow
treatment as the hero. Interior cutouts aren't touched here at all.

Both hero and framed are just compose_hero() calls with different
layouts/car lists; this module's only job is deciding which cutout goes
where and writing the files. See hero.py for the actual composition
(background fit, spotlight, glow, border collision-avoidance).
