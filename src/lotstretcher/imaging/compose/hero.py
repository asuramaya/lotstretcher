Hero image composition: background + car cutout(s) + branded border frame.

Layer order (bottom to top): background (scaled/cropped to fill the
canvas, adaptively dimmed toward the edges) -> car cutout(s) (optionally
glowing), scaled and positioned per the chosen layout -> border (its own
alpha handles the window automatically, so it just sits on top without
extra masking logic).

See imaging/assets.py for how borders/backgrounds are looked up by
name/tag rather than hardcoded paths, imaging/select.py for picking which
angle-classified cutout goes in which layout slot, and layout.py/
background.py/effects.py in this package for the pieces this wires
together.

    car_paths[0] is always the hero (drives the spotlight measurement and
    center). car_paths[1:] fill whatever accent slots `layout` defines --
    see imaging/compose/layout.py for what each layout name expects (e.g.
    "quad" wants [hero, front, back, side]). Extra car_paths beyond what
    the layout has slots for are silently unused; fewer than the layout
    expects just leaves those slots empty.

    background_path may be a path OR an already-built PIL Image -- the
    generated gradients (background.py::gradient_background()) are made
    per-image and never hit disk, so there'd be nothing to pass a path to.

    border_path may be None for a FRAMELESS composition. The border
    normally does three jobs at once: it defines the window the cars are
    laid out in, it supplies the alpha mask placements are collision-
    checked against, and it's the top layer. With no border, the window
    becomes the whole canvas (hence canvas_size, which the border's own
    dimensions would otherwise have decided) and there is nothing to
    collide with, so that check is skipped rather than run against an
    empty mask.

    margin_frac is the breathing room left inside each layout box. The
    0.06 default suits layouts that must also look right half-empty; the
    "conveyor" layout is tuned around a tighter one (see its docstring),
    since all its slots are always filled.
