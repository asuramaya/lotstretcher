"""
Wheel money-shot detection and extraction: find a "detail" photo that's
genuinely a rolling wheel shown at a good 3/4-ish angle (not a mirror/
badge/light/handle/tread-texture-only/mounted-spare shot that CLIP's
broader "detail" label also catches) and cut the wheel out cleanly.

Final architecture -- four stages, each a model/check doing the one thing
it's actually built for:

  1. IS it a wheel: WheelDetailClassifier + SpareTireClassifier (CLIP
     zero-shot, see classify.py). Kept narrow and separate on purpose --
     one big multi-way classifier misfired badly (a spare-tire label
     pulled in genuine clean wheel shots); CLIP zero-shot is far more
     reliable choosing between a few sharply-contrasted labels than among
     many overlapping ones in a single pass.
  2. WHERE is it: CLIPSeg (text-conditioned segmentation, "a car wheel
     and tire") -> bounding box only. Its semantic localization is
     excellent; its mask EDGES are low-res/fuzzy, so the mask itself is
     never used as an alpha channel -- only its bounds.
  3. CUT it out: SAM2 (facebook/sam2.1-hiera-small) prompted with that
     box on the FULL photo. SAM2 is promptable object-level segmentation
     -- it returns a crisp, complete, single-object mask, so there is
     nothing downstream to patch.
  4. Is the ANGLE right: the mask bbox's aspect ratio (width/height) must
     fall in a calibrated band -- too tall/narrow is a front/back tread-on
     shot, too wide is a mis-segmentation that grabbed body alongside the
     wheel (see MIN_/MAX_ANGLE_ASPECT for the measured gaps on each side;
     a CLIP good-angle/bad-angle classifier was tried first and wrongly
     rejected genuinely good shots -- geometry is the honest signal here).
  5. Is the RESULT a wheel: the finished cutout is re-classified by
     WheelDetailClassifier as a last independent check -- a
     well-proportioned mask of the wrong object still gets caught.

How it got here (condensed; the failures were all real, on real inventory
photos across 17 vehicles):

  - Hough-circle geometry for localization: high false-positive rate
    (door handles, mirrors, badges, headlights all score like wheels --
    geometry can't know what it's a circle OF), and even after CLIP took
    over the is-it-a-wheel call, Hough kept locking onto the wheel-well
    ARCH instead of the tire, so crops bled fender.
  - rembg (saliency matting) for the cutout: beautiful edges, no concept
    of "wheel". Four distinct real failure modes on production photos:
    brake calipers visible through spoke gaps cut out as holes; dark tire
    rubber dropped wholesale against dark wheel wells (one wheel reduced
    to a bare floating rim); soft shadow kept as foreground; fender bleed
    at crop corners.
  - A growing stack of geometric repairs on top of rembg (mask union with
    CLIPSeg, scipy hole-filling, RANSAC ellipse fitting with crop-border
    exclusion, a centroid-symmetry "fabrication gate", a rim-only
    fallback) fixed each failure it targeted but kept minting new edge
    cases -- and on one pristine, fully-visible wheel photo the whole
    stack still shipped garbage. The lesson that ended it: every layer
    existed to reconcile two models that were each half-blind (CLIPSeg
    knows WHAT but not exactly WHERE; rembg draws WHERE but not WHAT).
    Swapping the cutout core for a model that does promptable
    pixel-accurate segmentation natively (SAM2) made the entire repair
    stack deletable: on the same 11-photo validation set that broke every
    previous revision, SAM2 one-shot masks were clean on all 10 good
    candidates (IoU 0.94-0.99, tire tread texture intact, no holes, no
    bleed, no fabrication) and the one genuine bad-angle photo still
    measured 0.53 aspect -- correctly rejected by stage 4.

SAM2 runs fully local via transformers (CUDA if available); weights
download once on first use (~180MB).
