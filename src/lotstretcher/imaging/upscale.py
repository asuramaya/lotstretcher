"""
Super-resolution for the final cutout images, via spandrel (no basicsr/
realesrgan pip package -- those depend on an abandoned basicsr release that
fails to build against current setuptools/Python).

Tomball Ford's source photos cap out at 960x720 (confirmed: requesting
larger CDN resize params like 2048x2048 just returns the same native size,
there's nothing bigger to fetch) -- so "higher resolution" has to mean
actual upscaling of what we have, not a bigger download.

Model choice matters a lot here. RealESRGAN_x4plus (the "standard" choice,
what this used originally) is trained with an adversarial/GAN loss, which
optimizes for "looks plausible" over "matches the source" -- on a real test
photo it fabricated the grille badge text into unreadable nonsense while
leaving the rest of the image looking sharp and confident, which is a much
worse failure mode than blur: it's not obviously wrong at a glance. This is
not a "current models aren't good enough yet" bug, it's the perception-
distortion trade-off (Blau & Michaeli 2018) -- upscaling is fundamentally
an ill-posed inverse problem, and any method producing more apparent detail
than the source contains is by definition inventing something. GAN/
diffusion models sit at the sharp-but-sometimes-fabricated end of that
trade-off; models trained WITHOUT the adversarial loss (pure L1/PSNR
objective) sit at the faithful-but-softer end, because confidently
inventing wrong pixels is directly penalized by their training loss.

Default model: SwinIR's real-world PSNR-oriented checkpoint (transformer-
based, trained on BSRGAN-style real degradations without a GAN loss).
Tested side-by-side against RealESRNet_x4plus (the non-GAN ESRGAN sibling)
and plain Lanczos on the same failing grille-badge crop: all three stayed
faithful (unlike the GAN model), but SwinIR recovered visibly more real
detail (sharper mesh pattern, crisper text edges) than RealESRNet, which in
turn beat Lanczos. Costs ~4x more time/memory than RealESRNet per image
(~32s vs ~8s on this GPU) -- pass model_name="realesrnet" for the faster/
lighter option if that trade-off matters more than the extra sharpness.

Weights are fetched once from each model's official release and cached in
imaging/weights/.

WHERE IT ACTUALLY PAYS OFF: measured across the fleet on disk (296 exterior
cutouts, 29 wheel crops) by running the real layout math (compose_placement)
against every composed canvas size (hero stills, hero video, all formats).
The general exterior cutout gallery lands at a median ~1.1x scale in the
composite -- only ~4% of cutouts get scaled past 2x, the range where 4x SR
starts to visibly beat plain Lanczos. Below that, the model's own tiled
pass costs 8-32s per image for a difference that isn't there. That's why
--upscale (cli.py) stays off by default for that gallery -- there's no
fabricated evidence it helps, and real evidence (this measurement) that it
mostly doesn't.

Wheel money shots are the opposite case, and get run through this
unconditionally (photos.py, not gated by --upscale): they're cropped tight
to a single wheel (median ~520px), then composited solo at hero size, which
scales them ~2.1x on average -- 59% of real wheel crops exceed 2x. That's
exactly the regime this module was built and tested for (the grille-badge
test above). Re-measure this split with `find imaging/upscale.py` in mind
if the photo vendor's crop framing or the hero canvas size ever changes --
both numbers above are empirical, not assumed.
