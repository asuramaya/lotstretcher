"""
rembg-based background removal / subject-presence detection for vehicle photos.

Two uses:
  1. Presence signal: does this image contain a large, car-shaped salient
     foreground object? This is a more reliable cross-check than CLIP's
     scene-label score for photos where dealer-branding overlays (banners,
     tiled watermarks) dominate the frame and confuse a holistic label
     score -- rembg's segmentation is spatially grounded, not just a global
     text/image similarity. See classify.py's docstring/notes for the case
     that motivated this (real exterior photos with a bold banner baked
     into the pixels scoring as "marketing" under CLIP alone).
  2. The actual cutout: composite the segmented subject onto a clean
     background for a polished "product photo" look.

Model weights download once on first use and run fully local afterward --
GPU via onnxruntime-gpu if available, else CPU. Default model is
birefnet-general rather than rembg's default u2net: side-by-side on our
test photos it produced visibly sharper edges (wheel spokes, roof rack,
mirror housings) with no soft blur fringe, and a lower ambiguous-alpha
fraction across the board (~0.003 vs ~0.01). Costs ~10s/image on this GPU
vs u2net's near-instant, which is fine for a batch job run in the
background but pass model_name="u2net" if you want the faster/lighter path.

FLEET MASK-QUALITY AUDIT (296 exterior cutouts): three proxy metrics --
boundary-ring "haloing" (near-white/gray semi-transparent fringe pixels,
the signature of background bleeding through the matte), boundary
raggedness (alpha-gradient variance, a jagged/noisy silhouette), and
top-band width irregularity (a proxy for a chopped mirror/antenna) --
flagged their worst ~20 cutouts each for a pixel-level look. All were
false positives on inspection, not real defects: the haloing metric
mostly fired on white/light-colored vehicles, where the body paint itself
sits in the same near-white/bright band the metric was watching for
background bleed -- a real Maverick/Transit/Jeep edge zoomed to 3x showed
a crisp cut straight onto magenta, no fringe. The width-irregularity
metric mostly fired on Bronco Sport roof antennas, which turned out to be
correctly preserved as a single unbroken thin line, not chopped -- that's
what a genuine thin protrusion looks like to a row-width profile, not a
defect. Also spot-checked a black-on-black bumper (Challenger) for the
"dark vehicle silhouette gets lost against shadow" concern -- boundary
was crisp there too. Consistent with the angle-classification and wheel-
selection audits: the pipeline's actual output is cleaner than a first
threshold-based pass over it suggests. No action taken.

    Tight close-up/detail shots (e.g. a grille filling the whole frame) give
    the segmentation model nothing to key a foreground/background split off,
    and it responds with a diffuse, low-confidence alpha map instead of
    failing loudly -- visually this looks like a faint "ghost" of the
    subject on an otherwise blank white composite. A clean segmentation is
    bimodal: most pixels are confidently foreground (alpha > 200) or
    confidently background (alpha < 20). We use the fraction of pixels stuck
    in between as a quality signal (measured on u2net: <2% on real clean
    cutouts, ~18% on the known failure case) and flag anything above
    MAX_AMBIGUOUS_FRACTION as unreliable, so callers can fall back to the
    original photo instead of shipping a blank-looking image.

    That ambiguous-fraction check only catches segmentation *failures*
    (diffuse/low-confidence masks) -- it does NOT tell you whether the
    photo is a whole-vehicle shot worth cutting out at all. A tight
    headlight/wheel/badge close-up segments just as CONFIDENTLY as a full
    car (same high contrast against the studio background either way), so a
    clean-looking segmentation can still be the wrong thing to cut out.
    "Is this a detail shot" is primarily CLIP's job (see pipeline.py /
    classify.py's "detail" label) -- but CLIP can miss a borderline crop
    (confirmed real cases: a wheel/fender close-up, and separately a
    grille/badge close-up on two different vehicles, all classified
    "exterior" and segmented as technically-clean cutouts). fills_frame is
    a second, independent check on exactly that geometry, folded into
    quality_ok as a backstop for whenever CLIP's label alone isn't enough.
    Originally required the subject to touch ALL four edges (the pure
    zoomed-in-close signature), but that missed a real variant: a crop cut
    off asymmetrically on 2-3 sides while leaving real margin on the
    other(s) -- same tight-crop problem, different framing. Counting edges
    touched (>= FRAME_FILL_MIN_EDGES) rather than requiring all 4 catches
    both without over-triggering -- see the constant's own comment for the
    calibration data.
