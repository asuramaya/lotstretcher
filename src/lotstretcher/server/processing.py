"""
One image, start to finish: fetch -> classify -> cutout -> composite.
Shared by the sync single-segment endpoint and the async batch worker so
there is exactly one place that decides what "process an image" means.

This is the CarCutter-API-COMPATIBLE surface's actual value-add -- the
request/response shapes exist to make switching cheap, but this module is
what does the work, using the same imaging pipeline as the CLI (evaluate_
photo, remove_background, compose_hero). No separate "server" model or
weights; server mode is a different front door onto the same pipeline.
