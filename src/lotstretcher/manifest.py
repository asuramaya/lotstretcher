Fetch manifest: skip re-scraping a vehicle that's already been pulled down,
so re-running lotstretcher on the same URL (a duplicate line in a batch file, an
accidental re-run, a URL list that overlaps a previous run) doesn't burn a
full Cloudflare-bypass browser session + CLIP/rembg pipeline for nothing.

Keyed by VIN when one can be pulled straight out of the URL (Tomball
Ford's VDP URLs embed it as a path segment: /vehicle/<VIN>/...), which is
what makes the skip actually save compute -- no fetch needed to know the
identity of the vehicle. Falls back to the normalized URL as the key for
any URL that doesn't shake out a VIN, which still dedupes exact repeats
within/across runs, just can't skip *before* the first fetch reveals
whatever this URL turns out to be.

One manifest per output directory (<out_root>/manifest.json), since
--out is what defines "one batch of listings" here.
