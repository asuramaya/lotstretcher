"""
Natural-language equipment search over already-scraped new/CPO inventory.

Prototype for a real ask: dealer.com's own inventory filters only expose
coarse facets (trim, color, price, drivetrain) -- there's no way to search
for "has a center console, not a folding bench" the way a shopper actually
thinks about a truck. But that level of detail already lives in the data:
imaging/sticker.py parses the real Ford Monroney window sticker into a
structured equipment grid (interior/exterior/functional/safety) plus an
optional-equipment list, with real literal strings like "Center Console",
"Split Fold Rear Seat", "60/40 Easyfold Rear Bench" -- confirmed against
the actual fleet on disk, not assumed.

Two pieces, deliberately separated by the CONCEPT_SYNONYMS/compile_query
boundary:

  1. The matcher (match_vehicle/search) -- deterministic, zero marginal
     cost, works over however the query got compiled.
  2. The query compiler (compile_query) -- turns "a center console and no
     folding bench" into structured include/exclude concepts. THIS
     PROTOTYPE compiles with a small curated synonym dictionary
     (CONCEPT_SYNONYMS) plus simple negation/connective parsing, not an
     LLM call -- no Anthropic API key is configured in this repo
     (confirmed: no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env, no anthropic package
     installed), so this is the zero-setup-cost version. Swapping
     compile_query() for a real small-model call later is a contained
     change: same SearchFilter contract, wider vocabulary coverage than
     any hand-curated dictionary could reach, at a fraction-of-a-cent per
     query. The dictionary here is intentionally narrow (seating/console/
     bench, the case that motivated this) rather than a guess at
     exhaustive automotive vocabulary.

Searches vehicles with a real parsed window sticker (window-sticker.json)
AND/OR a vision-extracted seat-config claim (vision-equipment.json, see
imaging/seat_vision.py) -- a vehicle with neither is excluded, not
searched with an empty blob. The sticker alone was a real, confirmed gap:
Ford's own template doesn't always print every trim's front-seat
configuration explicitly (a real F-350 Lariat's sticker lists "Htd/
Ventilated Frt Seats" but never says bucket vs bench/console at all for
that trim), and used vehicles mostly have no sticker at all. Vision
extraction closes both: it answers directly from a real interior photo
(confirmed against sticker-verified ground truth before being wired in --
2/2 correct at high confidence, and the one genuinely ambiguous photo was
correctly flagged "can't tell" rather than guessed), and it doesn't need a
sticker to exist in the first place, so it's the only source of equipment
search coverage for used vehicles that never had one.
