"""
Download, parse, and render a vehicle's window sticker.

Distinct from imaging/sticker.py (which only parses PDF *content* --
equipment/pricing/warranties, and finds where a two-panel page's gutter
sits): this module owns the download, the placeholder-PDF check, the
pdftoppm render, and turning that render into two clean portrait panel
images. imaging/sticker.py is a pure PDF-text library; this is the
pipeline that drives it.
