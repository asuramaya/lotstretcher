Rebuild the post text for vehicles already on disk, without re-scraping.

    posts_cli.py ~/Documents/listings                 # every vehicle
    posts_cli.py ~/Documents/listings/used/2021-Vol   # just one

Post copy is derived entirely from details.json, so a wording change, a new
surface, or a fixed hashtag rule shouldn't cost a Cloudflare-bypass browser
session and a full CV pipeline per vehicle.

Deliberately NOT folded into recompose_cli.py: that tool finds vehicles by
looking for images/exterior/cutout/, because composition is meaningless
without cutouts. Post text only needs details.json, and there are real
folders with one and not the other -- a vehicle whose photos were all
filtered, or one scraped before the imaging pipeline ran. Keying off the
wrong marker would silently skip exactly those.
