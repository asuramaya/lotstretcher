"""
Automated inventory sync — the daemonless cron-friendly companion.

Ties together lotstretcher's listing expansion, fetch pipeline, manifest tracking,
and delist detection into a single command that's safe to run from cron.

Usage:
    inventory_sync.py                                          # uses defaults
    inventory_sync.py --config /path/to/dealer-config.json
    inventory_sync.py --dry-run                                # preview only

Environment variables (see README.md):
    LOTSTRETCHER_INVENTORY_URL     — dealer inventory listing URL
    LOTSTRETCHER_LISTINGS_ROOT     — where to store output
    LOTSTRETCHER_CONFIG            — path to dealer config file
