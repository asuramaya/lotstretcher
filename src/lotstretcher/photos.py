    Download the gallery, drop known junk templates (pHash), and -- if a
    classifier is supplied -- sort survivors into images/exterior/ and
    images/interior/, dropping anything CLIP+rembg agree has no real vehicle
    in it (see imaging/pipeline.py). Exterior photos also get a best-effort
    white-background cutout saved to images/exterior/cutout/ under the same
    number, skipped when imaging/cutout.py's quality gate flags the
    segmentation as unreliable (typical for tight detail shots) -- the
    original stays in images/exterior/ either way.

    A "detail" close-up (imaging/pipeline.py's DETAIL_LABEL) skips that
    cutout -- but if wheel_classifier and spare_classifier are supplied and
    imaging/wheel.py's full gate confirms it's genuinely a rolling wheel at
    a real 3/4 money-shot angle (not the mirror/badge/light/handle/tread/
    mounted-spare/front-tread-on shots that label also catches), it gets
    its own tightly-cropped cutout saved to images/exterior/wheels/
    instead, for a dedicated "wheel money shot" composition. The same
    wheel treatment also applies to a photo the scene classifier called
    "exterior" when WheelDetailClassifier confidently disagrees -- see the
    routing comment in the loop below for the real misrouted-partial-shot
    cases that made this necessary.

    With strict_cutouts (the default), the finished cutout gallery then has
    to vouch for its own members: any cutout that neither resembles nor is
    painted like its siblings is deleted and its photo is DEMOTED to
    images/interior/ rather than discarded -- see imaging/gallery.py for
    the two real failures that motivated this and the five approaches that
    didn't work. Demotion rather than deletion because those photos are
    fine photos that simply shouldn't have been cut out (a shot through
    the windshield, a van's cargo bay), and "shouldn't be cut out" is the
    definition of the interior gallery here.

    Without a classifier, falls back to the flat images/NN.ext layout.

    `out_root`/`own_folder`, when both given, enable the cross-vehicle
    photo cache (imaging/dedupe.py): a downloaded photo whose exact bytes
    were already seen (and cut out) for a DIFFERENT vehicle reuses that
    cutout instead of re-running rembg, and skips the CLIP scene-classify
    call too, since the category is already known. Confirmed real payoff:
    dealer.com's CDN mints a fresh unique URL per vehicle even for
    byte-identical manufacturer stock renders, so dozens of same-trim new
    vehicles (e.g. Bronco Sport BIG Bend) redundantly pay full CLIP+rembg
    cost on the SAME image over and over otherwise. Every photo is still
    saved to this vehicle's own gallery exactly as without the cache --
    this only skips redundant compute, never output. Off (falls through
    to full processing every time) when either argument is omitted.
