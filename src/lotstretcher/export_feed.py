"""
Build a vehicle inventory feed (CSV/TSV) from vehicles already scraped by
lotstretcher, in the shape third-party listing platforms (Meta/Facebook
Automotive Inventory Ads, and by convergent convention most others)
expect to ingest.

WHY THIS EXISTS: there is no open, universal automotive inventory feed
standard (confirmed via research, 2026-09) -- every DMS/inventory-
management-system integration (HomeNet, vAuto, Dealer.com) is a bespoke,
gatekept, vendor-credentialed relationship, not something a small tool can
self-serve into. But EXPORTING a feed needs nobody's permission -- you
just produce a file in the shape the destination already expects. That's
what this does: lotstretcher already has everything a feed needs (VIN, price,
mileage, colors, the dealer's own real public photo URLs) sitting in
details.json from the normal scrape -- this just re-shapes it.

FIELD-MAPPING CAVEAT, read before trusting this in production: Meta's own
canonical field-by-field spec for Automotive Inventory Ads lives behind a
JS-rendered, partially login-gated Business Help Center page that could
not be fetched directly while building this. FEED_COLUMNS below is built
from a field set that converged consistently across several independent
secondary sources (vehicle_id, title, url, make/model/year/trim, vin,
mileage.value/mileage.unit, price, state_of_vehicle, body_style,
image[N].url, address) -- reasonably trustworthy as a shape, but NOT
verified against Meta's own feed validator. Run the output through Meta
Commerce Manager's feed validator (or your platform's equivalent) before
relying on it, and adjust FEED_COLUMNS/vehicle_to_row() -- deliberately
kept as one flat mapping table, not scattered logic -- if reality differs.

Usage:
    from lotstretcher.export_feed import build_rows, write_csv
    rows = build_rows(vehicle_folders)
    write_csv(rows, Path("feed.csv"))
