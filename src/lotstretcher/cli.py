lotstretcher: pull a Tomball Ford vehicle detail page (VDP) into a folder of
photos, a window sticker screenshot, and a Facebook-ready copy/paste post.

Usage:
    lotstretcher <vdp-url> [<vdp-url> ...]
    lotstretcher --file urls.txt
    lotstretcher <vdp-url> --out listings
    lotstretcher <filtered-inventory-listing-url>       # expands to every vehicle it lists
    lotstretcher <listing-url> --dry-run                # preview what it would expand to, without fetching
    lotstretcher <local-photo-folder> [<local-photo-folder> ...]  # no VDP at all -- see local_source.py

This file is just the CLI surface -- argument parsing and the batch loop.
The actual work is split across:
    scrape.py            fetch the VDP, parse it into a Vehicle record
    listing.py           expand a filtered inventory listing URL into VDP URLs
    photos.py            download + sort + cutout the photo gallery
    window_sticker.py    download/render/split the window sticker PDF
    facebook_post.py     build the ready-to-paste post text
    vehicle_pipeline.py  process_vehicle(): wires the above together for one URL
    manifest.py          tracks completed fetches so re-running is a no-op
    imaging/             the CV pipeline (CLIP sorting, cutouts, compose, sticker PDF parsing)
See each module's own docstring for how its piece works.

Each vehicle gets one output folder, organized so source material and
finished deliverables don't mix:
    <vehicle-folder>/
        images/                  originals + cutouts (see imaging/ above)
        window-sticker.pdf       source document, if one was found
        window-sticker.json      structured data parsed from it (imaging/sticker.py)
        bundle/                  everything meant to actually be posted/shared:
            hero.png               the composed hero shot, square
            hero-portrait.png      same hero at 4:5 for Instagram/Facebook feed
            hero-video.mp4         animated hero, square (Marketplace/feed)
            hero-video-vertical.mp4    same edit, 9:16 (Reels/Stories/TikTok/Shorts)
            hero-video-horizontal.mp4  same edit, 16:9 (YouTube)
            framed/                every exterior cutout solo-composed just as big,
                                     including any confirmed wheel money shots
                                     (see imaging/wheel.py -- most vehicles won't have one)
            window-sticker-*a/b.png  rendered sticker, split into 2 readable panels
            facebook.txt            ready-to-paste Marketplace/Facebook post
            threads.txt             same vehicle inside Threads' 500-char cap
            instagram.txt           hook-first caption + hashtag block
        details.json             full scraped Vehicle record
<out>/manifest.json       cumulative fetch record across all runs (see --force)
<out>/run-summary.json    what happened in THIS run (see write_batch_summary())
<out>/runs.jsonl         append-only history of every run's outcomes, one row per URL
<out>/photo-hashes.json  per-vehicle gallery hashes, for spotting stock renders reused
                          across listings (see imaging/dedupe.py)
